                                ARA Design is more of a family or an institution that is a brainchild of Amey Dahanukar (MA Urban Design, UK) and also a partner of Dahanukar Associates. After completing his Masters in Urban Design from New Castle University , he believes delving into the technicalities, it feels as though Urbanism is the father of it all that helps put together built fabric and amalgamate it into a living space. ARA, forms a charismatic design firm excelling in Design, Architecture, Urbanism and Interiors. Our varied clientele exhibits our diverse work exposure. Our forte is building relationships.

                                With his great vision for ARA, Amey Dahanukar mentions, "We look at creating design that goes beyond a person. We want to speak of a language in architecture thatâ€™s more universal and inclusive. I am also constantly reminded of how much there is to learn. It is in search of these moments and these opportunities to learn that I am most alive."
